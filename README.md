## 🦅 Introduction (The Legend)
**LX-TITAN** is a military-grade security framework designed to turn your software into a **digital fortress**. Unlike traditional libraries, LX-TITAN operates with an **Active Defense Engine** that monitors memory, detects threats in real-time, and neutralizes reverse engineering attempts before they even start.

Built for high-performance environments (VS Code, Termux, Android Studio), it provides a seamless **"Plug & Protect"** experience.
